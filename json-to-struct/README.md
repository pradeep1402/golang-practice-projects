2. JSON to Struct Converter
   ⏱ Duration: 2–3 hours

🧠 Concepts: Structs, encoding/json, struct tags, type inference, error handling

🔖 Tags: structs, json, parsing, encoding

✅ Project Goal
Create a small Go program that takes a JSON file as input and generates Go struct definitions based on the JSON structure.

For example:

Given this input JSON file:

{
name: Alice,
age: 30,
email: alice@example.com,
isMember: true
}
The output should be a Go struct like:

type AutoGenerated struct {
Name string
Age int  
 Email string
IsMember bool  
}
